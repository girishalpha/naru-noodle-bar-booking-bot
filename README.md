An automated booking system for **Eat Naru** and other AirMenu-powered restaurant booking sites using Selenium WebDriver.

## Welcome Contributors ðŸŽ‰
### WIP
Contributions are welcome to expand support for more booking platforms and features.


This bot is currently designed for **Eat Naru**, but testing is only possible on Mondays. In the meantime, work is ongoing to adapt and test it for another AirMenu-powered site.

- **Target Site**: Cafe Air Booking  
- **Update `.env`**:  
  ```env
  BOOKING_URL=https://bookings.airmenus.in/CafeAir/CafeAir
  ```

Steps to adapt and test for the new site:

1. Update the `BOOKING_URL` in the `.env` file with the URL of the new site.
2. Modify XPath or CSS selectors in `booking_bot.py` to align with the new site's specific elements.
3. Run the bot on the new site and document any discrepancies encountered during testing.
